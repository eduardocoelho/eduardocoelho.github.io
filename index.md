My name is Eduardo Coelho, I am a software developer mainly interested in mobile applications. I am an optimist startup enthusiast and some of my interests include technology, architecture, design and traveling.

I started developing native iOS applications in 2008 and also worked with Xamarin cross-platform applications in 2012. I currently develop casual games with Unity3D for iOS and Android platforms.

I am enjoying life at my home office in Api√∫na, SC (Brazil), from where I work as a remote developer since 2013. I value work ethic and flexibility and I am always on the lookout for interesting new things to learn.
