My name is Eduardo Coelho. I’m a software developer with a strong interest in mobile applications. I’m an optimistic startup enthusiast, and my interests include technology, architecture, design, and traveling.

I run Redstone Games, a mobile game studio focused on publishing casual games for iOS and Android platforms. Currently, I’m the product owner of Crossword Puzzle Redstone, a cross-platform mobile application designed for English-speaking crossword solvers.

I began developing native iOS applications in 2008 and worked with Xamarin cross-platform apps starting in 2012. Today, I focus on creating casual games using Unity3D for both iOS and Android platforms.

I enjoy life at my home office in Balneário Camboriú (SC, Brazil), where I’ve been running my company and working remotely since 2018. I value work ethic and flexibility, and I’m always on the lookout for new and interesting things to learn.
